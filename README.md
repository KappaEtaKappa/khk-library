# khk_library
Library search engine frontend / backend for Kappa Server


The KHK Library is a simple search engine developed so that endusers may search for
books in the library that is at Delta Chapter. Users can use the following searches 
in the search engine to find resources:

1) ID
2) ISBN-10
3) ISBN-13
4) SBN
5) Title
6) Author

The search engine will eventually be tied to the Google Books API so that informationcan be pulled to fill missing data in the library database.
