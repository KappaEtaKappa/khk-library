###About
>The library app can be found at library.d.khk.org and was built to generate a searchable database of all academic books within the library at the Delta Chapter. The app is lightweight, requiring only a searchable string (i.e. author, title, text descriptor, or other).  Books are listed by relevance and include images, ISBN numbers, and a link to the google books database for further information.

##Installation
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:KappaEtaKappa/khk-library.git
```

>It is important to place this repo folder adjacent to all other services that consume khk-ssa's functions. (more to be seen later)

```bash
$ npm install
```
